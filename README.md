# MyInfiniteScroll
In this project:
- I used Unsplash API
- Wrote a function to help me clear the code
- Used a loader in svg
- Made a site fully responsive on mobile phones

  How it works?
  When you're scrolling and you finally reach the end of the page, images gets downloaded and set into the page.
